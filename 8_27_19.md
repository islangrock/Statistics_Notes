x(1), x(2), ... x(n)

mean = [x(1) + x(2)+...+x(n)]/n = $\sum_{x = 1}^{n} f(x(i))$/n


Basic commands
mean(variable): 
sort(variable): lowest-> hightest
median(variable)

mean & median are measures of location: they will move x distance when +/- x. 
mean is more likely to be skewed by outliers, most of statistics built on the mean however which can produce issues.

summary(variable): min, max, median, mean, quartiles (also a measure of location) 

low<- variable<=median
variable[low] : pull out values lower than the median
variable[!low]: pull out values not (!) than the median 

boxplot(variable): plots a boxplot (information from summary)

sample variance: $s^2$ = $\sum_{x = 1}^{i} f(x(i) -mean)$/n-1
